          Our Mission<br>
          To increase the educational experience of the users about
          space and the balanced systems interactions by allowing the users to
          play our game.
          About<br>
          We are all students at STEM Alex school, when the challenges of NASA
           Space apps are revealed we constructed our team and when we were
           constructing the team we believed that we should win and we should
            put some goals to work on because life is meaningless without goals.
             We chose our challenge and started to make our game, but before
             starting we put our goals which are increasing the educational
             experience about space interactions and reducing the ignorance
             about them. After working on and finishing our game we hope having
             the first place in this competition as it will be our first step
             to improve it and apply it in larger scale.<br>
