Actually, No problem without solutions and no solutions without problem, so our
 game’s aim is to reduce the ignorance about space and stars interactions by
 allowing the user to create planets and stars by customizing their properties
 like mass, density and size, after creating the planets and the stars and the
  whole balanced system, they will be able to see the simulation of their system
   and this will make them more interested about the space and that’s our aim.
