					NASA Enters the Solar Atmosphere for the First Time, Bringing New Discoveries
				</h2>

				<p>
				
					NASAâ€™s Parker Solar Probe is the first-ever mission to "touch" the Sun. 
					The spacecraft, about the size of a small car, travels directly through the Sun's atmosphere --ultimately to a distance of about 4 million miles from the surface. 
					Our challenge is to create a way to inform the young audience of this historical moment. 
				</p>
				<div class="inner-container">

					The solution we are planning to work on is about a video game. 
					This video games walks through the different stages that the probe went through its journey. 
					The game uses augmented reality in order to increase interactivity. 
					The Parker Solar Probe went through a lot of difficulties and challenges, 
					which will allow us to introduce people to these problems and how they were solved. 
					We aim for a creative solution that will teach the user of the game about the probe and its journey from the process of manufacturing until touching the sun in a fun and interactive way.

					<p>
						The game will consist of different stages, each stage is about a different stage of the probe's journey to the sun. 
						The game uses augmented reality. 
						This means that the player interacts with the game using hand gestures, 
						captured using a camera instead of traditional controls. 
						The other unique element regarding our video game is the story telling aspect, 
						our game story will be divided into two main plots. 
						The first stage will be about the manufacturing and preparing Parker Solar Probe, 
						which will educate the audience about the engineering part of the journey. 
						The second stage will be about the lunching of the Probe and the challenges it faced outside our planet. 
						Nevertheless, our solution mechanism will depend mainly on Computer Vision which is considered as a field of Artificial Intelligence. 
						The libraries we are going to use will be Open CV and MediaPipe. 
						For the video game itself, Pygame will be used.
