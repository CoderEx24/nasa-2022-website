        <p>
          We collected our game database from NASA data…… and we used this data
          to build balanced star system according to the laws of physics.<br>
        <h2>  Universal gravitational law: </h2>
        <p>The Law of Universal Gravitation states that every point mass attracts
        every other point mass in the universe by a force pointing in a straight
         line between the centers-of-mass of both points, and this force is
         proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional
         to their separation This attractive force always points inward,
          from one point to the other. The Law applies to all objects with masses,
          big or small. Two big objects can be considered as point-like masses,
          if the distance between them is very large compared to their sizes or
          if they are spherically symmetric. For these cases the mass of each
          object can be represented as a point mass located at its
          center-of-mass. <br>


          <h2>Orbital velocity:</h2>

        <p>Objects that travel in uniform circular motion around the Earth are said
         to be "in orbit". The velocity of this orbit depends on the distance
         from the object to the center of the Earth. The velocity has to be just
          right, so that the distance to the center of the Earth is always the
          same. The orbital velocity formula contains a constant, G, which is
          called the "universal gravitational constant". Its value is
           = 6.673 x 10-11 N∙m2/kg2 .The radius of the Earth is 6.38 x 106 m.

        <br><h2>Kepler’s third law:</h2>

        <p>The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional
        to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This captures the
        relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their
        orbital periods.
          <br><h2>Types Of planets:</h2>
          <p>Our solar system contains three types of planets: Rocky,
            terrestrial worlds (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) Gas giants
            (Jupiter and Saturn) Ice giants (Uranus and Neptune).Planets orbiting
            distant stars come in an even wider variety, including Lava worlds
            and “Hot Jupiters.” Here you can find more in breif Planet type and
            Description By mass regime Giant planet :- A massive planet. They
            are most commonly composed primarily of 'gas' (hydrogen and helium)
            or 'ices' (volatiles such as water, methane, and ammonia), but may
            also be composed primarily of rock. Regardless of their bulk
            compositions, giant planets normally have thick atmospheres of
             hydrogen and helium. Mesoplanet :-	Mesoplanets are planetary bodies
             with sizes smaller than Mercury but larger than Ceres. The term was
             coined by Isaac Asimov. Assuming "size" is defined by linear
             dimension (or by volume), mesoplanets should be
             approximately 1,000 km to 5,000 km in diameter. Mini-Neptune
             	:- A mini-Neptune (sometimes known as a gas dwarf or transitional
              planet) is a planet smaller than Uranus and Neptune, up to 10 Earth
               masses. Those planets have thick hydrogen–helium atmospheres,
               probably with deep layers of ice, rock or liquid oceans
               (made of water, ammonia, a mixture of both, or heavier volatiles).
Planetar either a brown dwarf :- an object with a size larger than a planet but
 smaller than a star—that has formed by processes that typically yield planets;
  or a sub-brown dwarf, —an object smaller than a brown dwarf that does not orbit
   a star. Super-Earth :- A super-Earth is an extrasolar planet with a mass higher
    than Earth's, but substantially below the mass of the Solar System's smaller
    gas giants Uranus and Neptune, which are 13 and 17 Earth masses respectively.
Super-Jupiter :- A super-Jupiter is an astronomical object that's more massive
than the planet Jupiter. Sub-Earth :-	Sub-Earth is a classification of planets
"substantially less massive" than Earth and Venus. Circumbinary planet
:-	An exoplanet that orbits two stars. Double planet (Binary planet):-	Two
 planetary-mass objects orbiting each other. Dwarf Planet :-	A planetary-mass
 object that orbits its star, which does not represent an overwhelming proportion
 of the mass in its orbital zone and does not control the orbital parameters of
  those objects (antonym: major planet) Eccentric Jupiter :- A gas giant that
  orbits its star in an eccentric orbit. Exoplanet :- A planet that does not
  orbit the Sun, but a different star, a stellar remnant, or a brown dwarf.
  Extragalactic planet :- An exoplanet outside the Milky Way. Goldilocks
  planet:-	A Goldilocks planet is a planet that falls within a star's habitable
   zone. The name comes from the children's fairy tale of Goldilocks and the
   Three Bears, in which a little girl chooses from sets of three items, ignoring
    the ones that are too extreme (large or small, hot or cold, etc.), and
    settling on the one in the middle, which is "just right". Hot Jupiter
     :- Jupiters are a class of extrasolar planets whose characteristics are
     similar to Jupiter, but that have high surface temperatures because they
     orbit very close—between approximately 0.015 and 0.5 astronomical units
     (2.2×106 and 74.8×106 km)—to their parent stars, whereas Jupiter orbits
     its parent star (the Sun) at 5.2 astronomical units (780×106 km), causing
     low surface temperatures. Hot Neptune	:- A hot Neptune is an extrasolar
     planet in an orbit close to its star (normally less than one astronomical
     unit away), with a mass similar to that of Uranus or Neptune. Inferior
     planets :- The planets whose orbits lie within the orbit of Earth.
     Inner planet :- The inner planets are those planets in the Solar System that
     have orbits smaller than the asteroid belt.[NB 2] Major planet	Planetary
     :- mass objects which orbit stars that dominate their orbital zone and
     comprise the vast majority of the mass in that zone (antonym: dwarf planet)
Outer planet :- The outer planets are those planets in the Solar System beyond
the asteroid belt, and hence refers to the gas giants. Pulsar planet :- Pulsar
planets are planets that are found orbiting pulsars, or rapidly rotating neutron stars.
Rogue planet (Interstellar planet) :- A rogue planet is a planetary-mass object
that orbits the galaxy directly. Superior planets :-	The planets whose orbits
lie outside the orbit of Earth. Trojan planet :- The discovery of a pair of
co-orbital exoplanets has been reported but later retracted.One possibility for
 the habitable zone is a trojan planet of a gas giant close to its star.
 By composition Chthonian planet :- An extrasolar planet that orbits close to its
  parent star. Most Chthonian planets are expected to be gas giants that had their
  atmospheres stripped away, leaving their cores. Carbon planet	:- A theoretical
   type of terrestrial planet that could form if protoplanetary discs are
   carbon-rich and oxygen-poor City planet	:- A hypothetical type of planet where
    all of its surface is urbanized. Coreless planet :- A theoretical type of
    planet that has undergone planetary differentiation but has no metallic core.
     It is not the same as a hollow Earth. Desert planet :- A theoretical type of
     terrestrial planet with very little water. Gas dwarf:- A low-mass planet
     composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Gas giant	:- A massive planet
     composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Helium planet :- A theoretical
     type of planet that may form via mass loss from a low-mass white dwarf.
     Helium planets are predicted to have roughly the same diameter as
     hydrogen–helium planets of the same mass. Ice giant:- A giant planet
     composed mainly of 'ices'—volatile substances heavier than hydrogen and
     helium, such as water, methane, and ammonia—as opposed to 'gas'
     (hydrogen and helium). Ice planet :- A type of planet with an icy surface
     and consist of a global cryosphere. Iron planet	:- A type of planet that
     consists primarily of an iron-rich core with little or no mantle.
     Lava planet :- A theoretical type of terrestrial planet with a surface mostly
      or entirely covered by molten lava. Ocean planet:- A theoretical type of
      planet which has a substantial fraction of its mass made of water.
      Protoplanet:- Protoplanets are large planetary embryos that originate
      within protoplanetary discs and have undergone internal melting to produce
      differentiated interiors. They are believed to form out of kilometer-sized
      planetesimals that attract each other gravitationally and collide.
      Puffy planet :- Gas giants with a large radius and very low density are
      sometimes called "puffy planets" or "hot Saturns", due to their density
      similar to or lower than Saturn's. Silicate planet:- A terrestrial planet
      that is composed primarily of silicate rocks. All four inner planets in
      our Solar System are of silicate type. Terrestrial planet:- A terrestrial
      planet, telluric planet or rocky planet is a planet that is composed
      primarily of carbonaceous or silicate rocks or metals.
