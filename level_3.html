				Touching the Sun
			</h2>

			<p>
				When approaching the sun, Parker Solar Probe was exposed to dangerous challenges including the Solar Wind, the Sun’s Magnetic Field, and Solar Switch Backs. 
				The first challenge for the probe is the Solar Wind, a constant stream of particles and magnetic ﬁelds that the sun releases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This solar wind slams worlds across the solar system with particles and radiation – which can stream all the way to planetary surfaces unless thwarted by an atmosphere, magnetic ﬁeld, or both. 
				The solar wind varies in density, temperature, and speed over time and over latitude and longitude. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After overcoming the challenge of the Solar Wind, Parker Solar Probe started to face the challenge of Sun’s magnetic field. 
				The Sun has a large and complex magnetic field, the Sun’s high temperature causes the positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons that make up its plasma to move around. 
				The moving plasma creates many complicated magnetic fields that twist and turn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The last challenge between Parker Solar Probe and the sun is the Solar Switchbacks. 
				For several years, solar scientists have known about a phenomenon they called 'switchbacks'. 
				Switchbacks are short-term 'flips' in the polarity of the magnetic field in the outflowing solar wind. 
				Parker Solar Probe has detected these 'switchbacks', which appear to be more plentiful closer to the Sun. 
				Nevertheless, Parker Solar Probe was able to overcome all these challenges, and finally touched the sun!
